## Overview

![Alt text](/documents/screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

Click the link above to see the demo. This project is built with React/Next.js with plain Javascript (no Typescript). It was the first time I tried out Next.js, and it worked out fine. Next.js features server side rendering for fast performance. 

It is built with my signature style with using a lot of inline styles that are composed programmatically.  


### Built With

I used Next.js (React) to build this app.

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

First, run the development server:
